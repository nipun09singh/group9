Group 9 - App Design Project

App overview:
In our project we hope to create an app that can compare prices of different grocery store items. 
The app will first ask the user for their location and then will ask for a certain product, focusing on generic rather than brand name products. 
For example, a user could compare prices for a bag of carrots at different grocery stores in their area. 
The app will provide users with a list of prices for their item(s) at different stores, ordered by price.
We hope to also expand the app to include delivery options as well.
